# Authentication & Multi-User Research Tasks

## Overview

Ideas capture feature requires multi-user support with proper authentication and data isolation. This document outlines research and implementation tasks for adding auth to the PowerPlatformCompanion app.

## Research Phase

### 1. Authentication Provider Analysis

**Task**: Research and compare auth providers suitable for the app
**Deliverables**:
- Provider comparison matrix (features, pricing, developer experience)
- Integration complexity assessment
- Security posture evaluation

**Providers to evaluate**:
- **Microsoft Entra ID** (Azure AD) - Natural fit for Power Platform audience
- **GitHub OAuth** - Developer-friendly, existing ecosystem
- **Google OAuth** - Broad user base
- **Auth0** - Comprehensive auth-as-a-service
- **Supabase Auth** - Simple, includes database integration
- **Netlify Identity** - Native Netlify integration

**Evaluation criteria**:
- Ease of integration with React/Netlify stack
- Support for multiple providers (social login)
- Token management and refresh handling
- Development/testing workflow complexity
- Cost implications
- Security features (MFA, session management)

### 2. Architecture Design

**Task**: Design multi-user architecture with proper data isolation
**Deliverables**:
- Data model with user ownership
- API security patterns
- Client-side auth state management
- Database schema design

**Key considerations**:
- User data isolation (ideas, settings, API keys)
- Shared vs private data models
- Permission levels (read/write/admin)
- Data migration from current localStorage approach

### 3. Development Workflow Impact

**Task**: Assess development and testing complexity with auth
**Deliverables**:
- Local development setup with auth
- Testing strategies for authenticated flows
- CI/CD pipeline considerations
- Environment management (dev/staging/prod)

**Areas to investigate**:
- Mock auth for local development
- Test user management
- Automated testing with auth flows
- Environment variable management
- Database seeding and cleanup

## Implementation Phase

### 4. MVP Authentication

**Task**: Implement basic auth with single provider
**Deliverables**:
- Auth provider integration (start with one)
- Login/logout flow
- Protected routes
- User session management

**Technical scope**:
- React auth context/hooks
- Route protection
- Token storage and refresh
- Logout and session cleanup

### 5. Data Persistence Layer

**Task**: Add database layer for multi-user data
**Deliverables**:
- Database setup (likely Supabase or similar)
- User data models
- Migration from localStorage
- API endpoints with auth

**Data models needed**:
- Users (profile, preferences)
- Ideas (with user ownership)
- AI settings (per-user API keys, models, prompts)
- Shared resources (templates, catalogs)

### 6. Ideas Capture Feature

**Task**: Build ideas capture with multi-user support
**Deliverables**:
- Ideas CRUD interface
- User ownership and privacy
- Search and filtering
- Export capabilities

**Features**:
- Add/edit/delete ideas
- Categorization and tagging
- Search across user's ideas
- Share ideas (optional)
- AI assistance for idea expansion

## Security Considerations

### 7. Security Review

**Task**: Comprehensive security assessment
**Deliverables**:
- Threat model
- Security controls implementation
- Penetration testing plan
- Security documentation

**Areas to cover**:
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Data access controls
- API security (rate limiting, validation)
- XSS/CSRF protection
- Secure token handling

## Testing Strategy

### 8. Auth Testing Framework

**Task**: Establish testing patterns for authenticated features
**Deliverables**:
- Unit test patterns for auth hooks
- Integration tests for auth flows
- E2E tests with auth scenarios
- Performance testing with auth overhead

## Migration Strategy

### 9. Backward Compatibility

**Task**: Plan migration from localStorage to authenticated storage
**Deliverables**:
- Data migration utilities
- Fallback modes for unauthenticated users
- Feature flag strategy
- User communication plan

**Migration approach**:
- Maintain localStorage as fallback
- Optional account creation
- Data import from localStorage
- Gradual feature gating

## Timeline Estimates

- **Research Phase**: 1-2 weeks
- **MVP Auth Implementation**: 2-3 weeks  
- **Data Layer & Migration**: 2-3 weeks
- **Ideas Capture Feature**: 1-2 weeks
- **Security & Testing**: 1-2 weeks

**Total estimated effort**: 7-12 weeks depending on complexity choices

## Decision Points

Key decisions needed during research:
1. **Auth provider choice** - Impacts integration complexity
2. **Database choice** - Affects development workflow
3. **Migration strategy** - Determines user experience
4. **Security level** - Balances usability vs protection
5. **Testing approach** - Affects development velocity

## Success Criteria

- Users can sign in with chosen auth provider(s)
- Ideas are properly isolated per user
- Existing features work for authenticated users
- Development workflow remains productive
- Security posture meets enterprise standards
- Migration path preserves user data
