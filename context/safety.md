# Safety & Data Handling

- No tenant-specific secrets, tokens, or PII. Redact if present.
- For licensing, include month/year and disclaimers; policies change.
- Prefer verifiable facts; if unsure, state uncertainty and assumptions.
- Refuse disallowed requests; offer safer alternatives when possible.
- Hallucination check: re-read claims; cite source packs when applicable.
